/*
 * This file contains a compressor for the LZX ("Lempel-Ziv eXtended"?)
 * compression format, as used in the WIM (Windows IMaging) file format.  This
 * code may need some slight modifications to be used outside of the WIM format.
 * In particular, in other situations the LZX block header might be slightly
 * different, and a sliding window rather than a fixed-size window might be
 * required.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *				 Format Overview
 *
 * The primary reference for LZX is the specification released by Microsoft.
 * However, the comments in lzx-decompress.c provide more information about LZX
 * and note some errors in the Microsoft specification.
 *
 * LZX shares many similarities with DEFLATE, the format used by zlib and gzip.
 * Both LZX and DEFLATE use LZ77 matching and Huffman coding.  Certain details
 * are quite similar, such as the method for storing Huffman codes.  However,
 * the main differences are:
 *
 * - LZX preprocesses the data to attempt to make x86 machine code slightly more
 *   compressible before attempting to compress it further.
 *
 * - LZX uses a "main" alphabet which combines literals and matches, with the
 *   match symbols containing a "length header" (giving all or part of the match
 *   length) and a "position slot" (giving, roughly speaking, the order of
 *   magnitude of the match offset).
 *
 * - LZX does not have static Huffman blocks (that is, the kind with preset
 *   Huffman codes); however it does have two types of dynamic Huffman blocks
 *   ("verbatim" and "aligned").
 *
 * - LZX has a minimum match length of 2 rather than 3.
 *
 * - In LZX, match offsets 0 through 2 actually represent entries in an LRU
 *   queue of match offsets.  This is very useful for certain types of files,
 *   such as binary files that have repeating records.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *			      Algorithmic Overview
 *
 * At a high level, any implementation of LZX compression must operate as
 * follows:
 *
 * 1. Preprocess the input data to translate the targets of 32-bit x86 call
 *    instructions to absolute offsets.  (Actually, this is required for WIM,
 *    but might not be in other places LZX is used.)
 *
 * 2. Find a sequence of LZ77-style matches and literal bytes that expands to
 *    the preprocessed data.
 *
 * 3. Divide the match/literal sequence into one or more LZX blocks, each of
 *    which may be "uncompressed", "verbatim", or "aligned".
 *
 * 4. Output each LZX block.
 *
 * Step (1) is fairly straightforward.  It requires looking for 0xe8 bytes in
 * the input data and performing a translation on the 4 bytes following each
 * one.
 *
 * Step (4) is complicated, but it is mostly determined by the LZX format.  The
 * only real choice we have is what algorithm to use to build the length-limited
 * canonical Huffman codes.  See lzx_write_all_blocks() for details.
 *
 * That leaves steps (2) and (3) as where all the hard stuff happens.  Focusing
 * on step (2), we need to do LZ77-style parsing on the input data, or "window",
 * to divide it into a sequence of matches and literals.  Each position in the
 * window might have multiple matches associated with it, and we need to choose
 * which one, if any, to actually use.  Therefore, the problem can really be
 * divided into two areas of concern: (a) finding matches at a given position,
 * which we shall call "match-finding", and (b) choosing whether to use a
 * match or a literal at a given position, and if using a match, which one (if
 * there is more than one available).  We shall call this "match-choosing".  We
 * first consider match-finding, then match-choosing.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *				 Match-finding
 *
 * Given a position in the window, we want to find LZ77-style "matches" with
 * that position at previous positions in the window.  With LZX, the minimum
 * match length is 2 and the maximum match length is 257.  The only restriction
 * on offsets is that LZX does not allow the last 2 bytes of the window to match
 * the beginning of the window.
 *
 * There are a number of algorithms that can be used for this, including hash
 * chains, binary trees, and suffix arrays.  Binary trees generally work well
 * for LZX compression since it uses medium-size windows (2^15 to 2^21 bytes).
 * However, when compressing in a fast mode where many positions are skipped
 * (not searched for matches), hash chains are faster.
 *
 * Since the match-finders are not specific to LZX, I will not explain them in
 * detail here.  Instead, see lz_hash_chains.c and lz_binary_trees.c.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *				 Match-choosing
 *
 * Usually, choosing the longest match is best because it encodes the most data
 * in that one item.  However, sometimes the longest match is not optimal
 * because (a) choosing a long match now might prevent using an even longer
 * match later, or (b) more generally, what we actually care about is the number
 * of bits it will ultimately take to output each match or literal, which is
 * actually dependent on the entropy encoding using by the underlying
 * compression format.  Consequently, a longer match usually, but not always,
 * takes fewer bits to encode than multiple shorter matches or literals that
 * cover the same data.
 *
 * This problem of choosing the truly best match/literal sequence is probably
 * impossible to solve efficiently when combined with entropy encoding.  If we
 * knew how many bits it takes to output each match/literal, then we could
 * choose the optimal sequence using shortest-path search a la Dijkstra's
 * algorithm.  However, with entropy encoding, the chosen match/literal sequence
 * affects its own encoding.  Therefore, we can't know how many bits it will
 * take to actually output any one match or literal until we have actually
 * chosen the full sequence of matches and literals.
 *
 * Notwithstanding the entropy encoding problem, we also aren't guaranteed to
 * choose the optimal match/literal sequence unless the match-finder (see
 * section "Match-finder") provides the match-chooser with all possible matches
 * at each position.  However, this is not computationally efficient.  For
 * example, there might be many matches of the same length, and usually (but not
 * always) the best choice is the one with the smallest offset.  So in practice,
 * it's fine to only consider the smallest offset for a given match length at a
 * given position.  (Actually, for LZX, it's also worth considering repeat
 * offsets.)
 *
 * In addition, as mentioned earlier, in LZX we have the choice of using
 * multiple blocks, each of which resets the Huffman codes.  This expands the
 * search space even further.  Therefore, to simplify the problem, we currently
 * we don't attempt to actually choose the LZX blocks based on the data.
 * Instead, we just divide the data into fixed-size blocks of LZX_DIV_BLOCK_SIZE
 * bytes each, and always use verbatim or aligned blocks (never uncompressed).
 * A previous version of this code recursively split the input data into
 * equal-sized blocks, up to a maximum depth, and chose the lowest-cost block
 * divisions.  However, this made compression much slower and did not actually
 * help very much.  It remains an open question whether a sufficiently fast and
 * useful block-splitting algorithm is possible for LZX.  Essentially the same
 * problem also applies to DEFLATE.  The Microsoft LZX compressor seemingly does
 * do block splitting, although I don't know how fast or useful it is,
 * specifically.
 *
 * Now, back to the entropy encoding problem.  The "solution" is to use an
 * iterative approach to compute a good, but not necessarily optimal,
 * match/literal sequence.  Start with a fixed assignment of symbol costs and
 * choose an "optimal" match/literal sequence based on those costs, using
 * shortest-path seach a la Dijkstra's algorithm.  Then, for each iteration of
 * the optimization, update the costs based on the entropy encoding of the
 * current match/literal sequence, then choose a new match/literal sequence
 * based on the updated costs.  Usually, the actual cost to output the current
 * match/literal sequence will decrease in each iteration until it converges on
 * a fixed point.  This result may not be the truly optimal match/literal
 * sequence, but it usually is much better than one chosen by doing a "greedy"
 * parse where we always chooe the longest match.
 *
 * An alternative to both greedy parsing and iterative, near-optimal parsing is
 * "lazy" parsing.  Briefly, "lazy" parsing considers just the longest match at
 * each position, but it waits to choose that match until it has also examined
 * the next position.  This is actually a useful approach; it's used by zlib,
 * for example.  Therefore, for fast compression we combine lazy parsing with
 * the hash chain max-finder.  For normal/high compression we combine
 * near-optimal parsing with the binary tree match-finder.

/*
 * lzx_choose_near_optimal_match() -
 *
 * Choose an approximately optimal match or literal to use at the next position
 * in the string, or "window", being LZ-encoded.
 *
 * This is based on algorithms used in 7-Zip, including the DEFLATE encoder
 * and the LZMA encoder, written by Igor Pavlov.
 *
 * Unlike a greedy parser that always takes the longest match, or even a "lazy"
 * parser with one match/literal look-ahead like zlib, the algorithm used here
 * may look ahead many matches/literals to determine the approximately optimal
 * match/literal to code next.  The motivation is that the compression ratio is
 * improved if the compressor can do things like use a shorter-than-possible
 * match in order to allow a longer match later, and also take into account the
 * estimated real cost of coding each match/literal based on the underlying
 * entropy encoding.
 *
 * Still, this is not a true optimal parser for several reasons:
 *
 * - Real compression formats use entropy encoding of the literal/match
 *   sequence, so the real cost of coding each match or literal is unknown until
 *   the parse is fully determined.  It can be approximated based on iterative
 *   parses, but the end result is not guaranteed to be globally optimal.
 *
 * - Very long matches are chosen immediately.  This is because locations with
 *   long matches are likely to have many possible alternatives that would cause
 *   slow optimal parsing, but also such locations are already highly
 *   compressible so it is not too harmful to just grab the longest match.
 *
 * - Not all possible matches at each location are considered because the
 *   underlying match-finder limits the number and type of matches produced at
 *   each position.  For example, for a given match length it's usually not
 *   worth it to only consider matches other than the lowest-offset match,
 *   except in the case of a repeat offset.
 *
 * - Although we take into account the adaptive state (in LZX, the recent offset
 *   queue), coding decisions made with respect to the adaptive state will be
 *   locally optimal but will not necessarily be globally optimal.  This is
 *   because the algorithm only keeps the least-costly path to get to a given
 *   location and does not take into account that a slightly more costly path
 *   could result in a different adaptive state that ultimately results in a
 *   lower global cost.
 *
 * - The array space used by this function is bounded, so in degenerate cases it
 *   is forced to start returning matches/literals before the algorithm has
 *   really finished.
 *
 * Each call to this function does one of two things:
 *
 * 1. Build a sequence of near-optimal matches/literals, up to some point, that
 *    will be returned by subsequent calls to this function, then return the
 *    first one.
 *
 * OR
 *
 * 2. Return the next match/literal previously computed by a call to this
 *    function.
 *
 * The return value is a (length, offset) pair specifying the match or literal
 * chosen.  For literals, the length is 0 or 1 and the offset is meaningless.

	 *    terminates when space in the @c->optimum array is exhausted.
	 *    This terminates the algorithm and forces it to start returning
	 *    matches/literals even though they may not be globally optimal.
	 *
	 * Upon loop termination, a nonempty list of matches/literals will have
	 * been produced and stored in the @optimum array.  These
